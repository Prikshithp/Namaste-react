1>In the world of web development, "Emmet" is a popular tool that helps programmers write code faster and more efficiently. It uses abbreviations and symbols to generate entire sections of code with just a few keystroke
2>Library:

It's like a toolbox filled with specific tools for different tasks.
You choose the tools you need and use them when you want.
Examples: Hammer for pounding nails, saw for cutting wood.
In coding: jQuery for animations, React for building user interfaces.
Framework:

It's like a pre-built house structure with rooms, walls, and a foundation.
You move in and decorate, but the overall structure is already there.
It tells you where to put things and how to connect them.
Examples: Angular, Vue, Spring for web applications.
